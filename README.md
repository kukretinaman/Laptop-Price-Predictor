# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview
Laptop Price Predictor is a web-based application developed to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and a user-friendly interface, this application provides accurate price estimations for different laptop configurations.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Render


## How it Works
1. **Data Collection**: The application uses a dataset containing information about various laptop models, including specifications and corresponding prices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for model training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression are explored to identify the best-performing model for price prediction. The selected model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
4. **User Interface**: The user interface is developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input laptop specifications through a simple and intuitive interface.
5. **Price Prediction**: Upon receiving user input, the trained model predicts the price of the laptop based on the provided specifications.
6. **Deployment**: The application is deployed on the Render platform, ensuring seamless accessibility and scalability for users.
